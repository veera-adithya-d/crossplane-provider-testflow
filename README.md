# Crossplane Provider for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

`crossplane-provider-oci` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider for [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) (OCI) that is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/upbound/upjet) code generation tools.

Upjet creates XRM-conformant managed resources for the OCI APIs based on [OCI Terraform Resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs).

## Crossplane Installation
Crossplane installs on top of Kubernetes. Install Crossplane onto a Kubernetes cluster using the following steps. Ensure correctness of Kubernetes context selected.

1. Create a namespace for Crossplane.
    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace crossplane-system
    ```
1. Add a Helm repository for Crossplane.
    ```bash
    helm repo add crossplane-stable https://charts.crossplane.io/stable
    ```
1. Update the Helm repository.
    ```bash
    helm repo update
    ```
1. Install Crossplane.
    ```bash
    helm install crossplane --namespace crossplane-system crossplane-stable/crossplane
    ```
1. Verify that Crossplane is deployed.
    ```bash
    helm list -n crossplane-system
    ```
1. Check for components installed as part of Crossplane on Kubernetes.
    ```bash
    kubectl get all -n crossplane-system
    ```
